	abstract = {In trying to solve multiobjective optimization problems, many traditional methods scalarize the objective vector into a single objective. In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAs) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAs in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAs along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-principle results obtained on three problems used by Schaffer and others suggest that the proposed method can be extended to higher dimensional and more difficult multiobjective problems. A number of suggestions for extension and application of the algorithm are also discussed.},

The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) is a relatively recent technique for finding or approximating the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems. In different studies SPEA has shown very good performance in comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has been a point of reference in various recent investigations. Furthermore, it has been used in different applications. In this paper, an improved version, namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems yields promising results.Other

	abstract = {The multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm (MOEA) is a powerful approach for tackling multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), which can find a finite set of approximate Pareto solutions in a single run. However, under mild regularity conditions, the Pareto optimal set of a continuous MOP could be a low dimensional continuous manifold that contains infinite solutions. In addition, structure constraints on the whole optimal solution set, which characterize the patterns shared among all solutions, could be required in many real-life applications. It is very challenging for existing finite population based MOEAs to handle these structure constraints properly. In this work, we propose the first model-based algorithmic framework to learn the whole solution set with structure constraints for multiobjective optimization. In our approach, the Pareto optimality can be traded off with a preferred structure among the whole solution set, which could be crucial for many real-world problems. We also develop an efficient evolutionary learning method to train the set model with structure constraints. Experimental studies on benchmark test suites and real-world application problems demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed framework.},
